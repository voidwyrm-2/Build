# CBuild
A C build system ~~that's definitely not discount CMake~~ written in Go

I had *way* too much fun writing this

* Go >= 1.22.1

First, install Go if you haven't already from [go.dev](go.dev)

Then, run this command:
```sh
go install "github.com/voidwyrm-2/CBuild@latest"
```

## Usage
Refer to the [CBuildfile example](./CBuildfile_example.txt) for instructions how to use CBuildfiles<br>
Use `cbuild -h` for command help
